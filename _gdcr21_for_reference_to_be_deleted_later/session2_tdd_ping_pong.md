## üèì
## TDD with Ping Pong

Let's do **TDD** and **Pair Programming** in a strict way,<br>
switching after each increment:

* **A** writes a test and sees that it fails.
* **B** writes the code needed to pass the test.
* **A** (or **B**) refactors the code as needed.
* **B** writes the next test and sees that it fails.
* **A** writes the code needed to pass the test.
* And so on.

---

### Tips

* Use the first few minutes to decide on an approach and create an
  initial test list.
* Start with a programming language you know.
* Make sure to see the test red or green before passing the keyboard to one another.

---

### Extra Challenge

Optional, for experienced participants:

* Don't use a mouse or keypad.

Not recommended, only for crazy participants:

* Don't move the cursor more than 2 lines with the arrow keys.
* Don't type Enter/Backspace/any key more than 2 times at once.
