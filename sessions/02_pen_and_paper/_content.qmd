## Our Kata: Supermarket Pricing

### Pricing goods at supermarkets

* The supermarket has a catalogue with different products (rice, apples, etc.).
* Each product has a price.
  * Item Products have simple prices. E.g. a can of beans costs €1.65.
  * Loose Weight Products have more complex prices. E.g. €1.99 per kilo.
* The total price of the shopping cart is the sum of all the prices of the items.
* Your receipt lists the items you've bought, the total price and discounts.
* The supermarket runs special deals like
  * Percent discount on item, e.g.
    10% discount on rice, normal price €2.49 per bag.
    20% discount on apples, normal price €1.99 per kilo.
  * Buy two toothbrushes, get one free. Normal toothbrush is €0.99.
  * X for Y discount, e.g.
    Five tubes of toothpaste for €7.49, normal price €1.79.
    Two boxes of cherry tomatoes for €0.99, normal price €0.69 per box.

## Our Mode of Work: Pen and Paper

Before we start coding, let's think:

* Identify concepts.
* How would we design such a system?
* Maybe do a verb-noun analysis.
* Make a sketch.
* Which actions/events are there?
* Be explicit.

Only work on requirements listed above!

## Extra Challenge: Decoupled Design

* Do we need to get data from somewhere? Do we need to write/print/format data somewhere?
* Which "concerns" are there? (If concern means anything to you.)
* Which domains/subdomains are involved? (If domain means anything to you.)

{{< include ../_learning_and_practicing.qmd >}}

{{< include ../_retrospective.qmd >}}

* Which parts are "different"?
* Which components did you identify?
* Are Stock and Shop the same domain? No? How do we handle it?
