## About
<br/>
The [Vienna software crafting community](https://swkwien.github.io/) invites you to participate
in our local event for the [Global Day of Coderetreat](https://www.coderetreat.org/).
<br/>
<br/>
On this day, we come together to learn from each other, practice pair programming &
test-driven development and focus on design aspects related to decoupling.
<br/>
<br/>
If that sounds interesting to you, we are thrilled to have you join us!
