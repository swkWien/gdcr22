A day of deliberate practice and learning.

### Deliberate Practice
<br>
Not about getting things done
<br>
<br>
Doing things differently
<br>
<br>
Try out new ideas
<br>
<br>
Do it right!

### Deliberate Learning

## How does a Coderetreat work?

We work on the same problem repeatedly.

Try out different approaches.

Learn from each other.

Practice!

Reflect!

Focus!
