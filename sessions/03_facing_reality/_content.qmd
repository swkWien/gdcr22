Facilitator: Patrick Scheibert, Katrin Heiderer

## Existing Code :-(

The code is there, we want to improve it.

## Code Review, Refactoring, Pair-Programming

* Read the code ("read by refactoring")
* Which design elements (aka classes) are there?
* How are they connected? Which classes hold which data?
* Which classes are doing what?
* Compare with your diagrams from session 1.

---

## Tips

* Start with small IDE refactoring steps.
* Rename the variables so they are more meaningful.
* Extract methods to reduce complexity of the code.

---

## Extra Challenges

### One Level of Indentation

Each method cannot contain statements that require more than one level of indentation (conditional statements, loops, etc)

### Short Methods

Limit the number of statements permitted for a function to 5 lines.

* Which refactorings did you do?

* Which class or method names did you change?

* What was your experience in the pairs with different languages?
