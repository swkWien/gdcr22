# Session 2

Focus: Facing Reality

Facilitator: Patrick Scheibert, Katrin Heiderer

---

## Code Review, Refactoring, 
## Pair Programming

* <i>Read the code ("read by refactoring")</i>
* <i>Which design elements (aka classes) are there?</i>
* <i>How are they connected? Which classes hold which data?</i>
* <i>Which classes are doing what?</i>
* <i>Compare with your diagrams from session 1.</i>

---

## Tips




* Start with small IDE Refactoring steps. 
* Rename the variables so they are more meaningful.
* Extract Methods to reduce complexity of the code.

## Extra Challenges

Optional, for experienced participants:

### One Level of Indentation
Each method cannot contain statements that require more than one level of indentation (conditional statements, loops, etc) 

        or

### Short methods
Limit the number of statements permitted for a function to 5 lines.
