# Session 2

Focus: Facing Reality

Facilitator: Patrick Scheibert, Katrin Heiderer

## Code Review, Refactoring, Pair Programming

* Read the code ("read by refactoring")
* Which design elements (aka classes) are there?
* How are they connected? Which classes hold which data?
* Which classes are doing what?
* Compare with your diagrams from session 1.

---

## TIPS

* Start with small IDE Refactoring steps. 
* Rename the variables so they are more meaningful.
* Extract Methods to reduce complexity of the code.
