# Session 2

Focus: Facing Reality

Facilitator: Patrick Scheibert, Katrin Heiderer

---

## Code Review, Refactoring, Pair-Programming


* Read the code ("read by refactoring")
* Which design elements (aka classes) are there?
* How are they connected? Which classes hold which data?
* Which classes are doing what?
* Compare with your diagrams from session 1.

---

## Tips

* Start with small IDE Refactoring steps.
* Rename the variables so they are more meaningful.
* Extract Methods to reduce complexity of the code.

---

## Extra Challenges

Optional, for experienced participants:

### One Level of Indentation
Each method cannot contain statements that require more than one level of indentation (conditional statements, loops, etc)

####

### Short methods
Limit the number of statements permitted for a function to 5 lines.
